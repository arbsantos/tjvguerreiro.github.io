Our paper on [Characterizing Social Insider Attacks on Facebook](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~tjvg/inconspicuous/social-insider-chi17.pdf) was accepted at CHI 2017. It was the output of a collaboration with researchers at the University of British Columbia. We present results from quantitative and qualitative studies that show that social insider attacks on Facebook, where pranks or facejacking are just examples, are common and present themselves with a variety of motivations.
