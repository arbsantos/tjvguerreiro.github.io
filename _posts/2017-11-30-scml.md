title: New project improving the autonomy of people with severe motor impairments
post: true
---

In this new project, we are collaborating with [SCML](http://www.scml.pt) in increasing the independence of young people living with tetraplegia. SCML are engaged in the creation of buildings that are accessible to people with severe motor impairments; our work will be to research and develop the user interfaces and underlying mechanisms that allow the users to control their environment, devices, and relevant services.

The vision is that a person with tetraplegia living in these facilities are able to (apart from the most pressing transfer, hygiene, dressing, and eating needs) communicate and control apppliances independently alongside accessing services through the system.
