We had two short papers accepted at ACM ASSETS 2017, to be held in Baltimore, Oct 29-Nov 2. One focuses on <a href="../pubs/sp008rodrigues.pdf">in-context crowdsourced smartphone support for blind people</a>. The second presents <a href="../pubs/sp100rodrigues.pdf">personalizable virtual overlays</a> to improve system-wide non-visual accessibility to smartphones. Congrats to Andr√© Rodrigues, that also had his <a href="../pubs/dc_assets17_andre_project.pdf">Doctoral Consortium proposal</a> accepted, and the SOS team. See you in Baltimore!
