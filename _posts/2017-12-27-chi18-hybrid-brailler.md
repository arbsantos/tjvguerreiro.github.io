Our paper [Hybrid-Brailler: Combining Physical and Gestural Interaction for Mobile Braille Input and Editing](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~tjvg/amc/chi2018_hybrid_brailler.pdf) was (conditionally) accepted at CHI 2018. The camera ready copy is available. The paper presents  Hybrid-Brailler, an input solution that combines physical and gestural interaction to provide fast and
accurate Braille input. We use the back of the device for physical chorded input while freeing the touchscreen for gestural interaction. Gestures are used in editing operations, such as caret movement, text selection, and clipboard control. We conducted two user studies to assess both input and editing performance. Results show that Hybrid-Brailler supports fast entry rates as its virtual counterpart, while significantly increasing input accuracy. Regarding editing performance, when compared with the mainstream technique, HybridBrailler shows performance benefits of 21% in speed and increased editing accuracy.
