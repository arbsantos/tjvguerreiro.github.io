The lab is growing. New projects and several new researchers and some upgrades.

António Barros is a visiting PostDoc researcher (one year) that focuses on inclusive haptic-based education for blind children.

Diogo Branco, a former MSc student, continues with the lab, now pursuing a PhD degree. He will continue working on healthcare for Parkinson's.

Álvaro Teles is a new MSc student working on usable intrusion detection and response for mobile devices.

Laíza Silva is a visiting MSc student (stay until May 2019) from Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil) working on gamified mobile applications to improve the literacy of young people with autism.
