The kick-off meeting of the [WAI-Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Tools/) EU H2020 project took place on the 28th of November in Brussels. This is an exciting project that will create the tools to support a more efficient evaluation of websites in line with supporting the implementation of the [Web Accessibility Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility).

The [LASIGE](http://lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/) team, composed of Luís Carriço, Carlos Duarte, and me, will be involved in the development and deployment of test rules, development of semantic evaluation tools, and with developing and evaluating the visualization report tools.
