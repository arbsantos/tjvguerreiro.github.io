title: Two papers accepted at ASSETS 2017
subtitle: We had two short papers accepted at ACM ASSETS 2017, to be held in Baltimore, Oct 29-Nov 2. One focuses on in-context crowdsourced smartphone support for blind people. The second presents personalizable virtual layers to improve system-wide non-visual accessibility to smartphones. Congrats to Andr√© and the SOS team. See you in Baltimore!
